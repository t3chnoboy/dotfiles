Molokai is a Vim port of the monokai theme for TextMate originally created by Wimer Hazenberg.

By default, it has a dark gray background based on the version created by Hamish Stuart Macpherson for the E editor.

You can see screenshots of the scheme at http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2008/08/12/MolokaiForVim.aspx

256-Color terminals are also supported, though there are some differences with the Gui version. Only the dark gray background style is supported on terminal vim at this time.
